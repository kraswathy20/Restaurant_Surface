React 
-----

npx create-react-app appName  -  To create an app

npm start                    -  to run an app

Building blocks of React
------------------------

html   - to load content
css    - to style
js     - to make the app dynamic

Angular(not developer friendly)  |            React(developer friendly)
-------                          |            -----
- Framework of javascript        |           - library of javascript
- real DOM                       |           - Virtual DOM(imaginary dom)
 (physical DOM present)                          (Dom is present but it is imaginary )
 Re-run the entire DOM                            Re-run only the updated component or section only
 Thus More runtime required                       less runtime 
 slower                                      - Faster 
                                             - Next.js framework of react

Advantages of React
-------------------
1. It uses Virtual DOM (faster)
2. reusable components
3. jsx is used as the coding language (Javascript xml)
4. fast and flexible                                             


components in React (rfce)
-------------------

1. class based -  statefull
2. function based -stateless (as it was stateless data cannot be stored and thus cannot used to build projects)

components are of 2 types -- 
statefull components  - component which conatin states.
stateless components  - component which does not contain state.

react updated and introduced hooks

React Hooks - used to create states inside function based components.
there are different types of hooks in react. One among them is to create states.

state
------
object used to store data inside a component in react


useState - hook used to create state      library - react

props          (properties)
-----
To share data from parent to child components.
destructuring - a new feature introduced in react to avoid using props.

API call in javascript
----------------------

Ajax
----

-XmlHttp
-fetch
-async and await

first working hook of a component
---------------------------------
useEffect  - react
